## Demo
A `terraform.tfvars` can be used for simplifying deployment variables:

```terraform
cloudflare_api_token = "" # Will change to ENV Variable
account_name        = "jtessman-sa"
project_name        = "cf-terraform-talk"

github_owner = "tessmanjonathan"
github_repo  = "cf-terraform-talk"
```
